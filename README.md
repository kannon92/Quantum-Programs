Various Quantum Chemistry Programs via plugins

GS corresponds to various implementations of electronic structure codes.  I have implemented MP2, DFMP2, AO-MP2, Finite Temperature Hartree Fock, and CD-MP2.  

ES corresponds to a Configuration-Interaction Singles code.  

These codes are not meant to be production level.
